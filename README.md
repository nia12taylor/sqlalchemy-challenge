Module 10 Advanced SQL Challenge by Mwohania (Nia) Taylor

Repo for UC Berkeley Data Analytics Bootcamp

## Background
This project outlines the process needed to conduct a climate anlysis using Python, SQL Alchemy, ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The Jupyter notebook climate.ipynb has the basic climate analysis code to connect with sqlite and SQLAlchemy. After this step you can create the Flask API and conduct the following analysis:
- Use the most updated dataset by identifying the variable for that date one year ago
- The first query will isolate the precipitation data and transform it in DataFrame
- Pandas can transform the data into a plot graph
- The next query will isolate the temperature from the most active station in the data set
- The daily temperature can be plotted in a histogram to demonstrate the frequenciy of the temperatures
